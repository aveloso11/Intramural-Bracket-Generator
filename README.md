## Data Model Overview
```
Match (tree node)
├── leftChild / rightChild  → previous-round matches feeding into this one
├── team1, team2            → competing teams (null = TBD/bye)
├── winner, score           → set when the match is played
├── round, matchId          → position in the bracket
└── flags: isPlayIn, isPlayInGrandFinal, isMainBracket, isWinnersBracket
```

```
Team
├── id, name
├── wins, losses
└── pointsScored, pointsAllowed → updated automatically when a match is completed
```

```
ScoreMatrix  (used in Round Robin / Swiss)
└── int[n][n] grid → scores[A][B] = points A scored against B (-1 if not yet played)
```
